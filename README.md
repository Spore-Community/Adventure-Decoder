# Spore Adventure Decoder
A Spore Adventure decoder, written in Java by [emd](https://github.com/emd4600).

This Java app allows you to extract data from adventures created in Spore Galactic Adventures.

It requires the data output from a [Spore PNG decoder](https://github.com/Spore-Community/PNG-Decoder-NetCore). The output file should be used as the input file for this app. You should specify this file in [simulator/cScenarioResource.java](simulator/cScenarioResource.java).

If you find any adventures that cannot be decoded with this app, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/Spore-Community/Adventure-Decoder/issues/new), and include the PNG itself, as we'd like to take a look.

This app is mostly provided for reference purposes. Feel free to take a look at the code and modify it. Please credit emd4600 (https://github.com/emd4600) as the author.
